# online-shopper-home-page
******
Copy your online shopper project so you donâ€™t ruin it and make a new repo for it. Submit Github link when completed here.

The home.ejs page is not DRY
Look at the repeating html code
Make it so that the code is only used once with values updated.
You may store values in a loaders.js file in your lib folder and transfer them to your routes
The page should look exactly the same.
